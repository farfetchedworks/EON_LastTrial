# EON: The Last Trial

A third person action-adventure game that takes place in a hostile lugubrious planet which will require the player to strategically use his melee and spacetime abilities in order to survive from maddened enemies. Defy death while trying to prevent the incipient destruction of the world ruled by Ukh, an ancient religion.
